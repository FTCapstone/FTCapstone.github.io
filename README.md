                        <p> As we embark on our Seeking Alpha virtual trading game project in the upcoming quarter, our focus will be on building a strong foundation in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This quarter will be dedicated to enhancing our understanding of these critical technologies, which play a pivotal role in modern trading decision-making. By exploring various ML and AI techniques, we aim to develop the analytical skills necessary to evaluate market trends, predict price movements, and optimize our trading strategies. This preparatory phase will empower us to make informed decisions and leverage data-driven insights as we transition into hands-on trading operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>We will have only discussions in a Q&amp;A form, instead of traditional lectures. The discussion questions are assignments for each week. </p>

                        <p> Technical indicators are mathematical calculations involving price, volume, open interest or other quantitative metrics used by traders to conduct technical analysis.
                        Technical indicators can be further divided into two categories based on their purpose:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li> Leading Indicators are designed to forecast where prices may be heading and are commonly used to generate buy and sell signals. For example, when the relative strength index (RSI) reaches an overbought level, the indicator suggests that traders should sell or go short a stock.</li>
                            <li> Lagging Indicators are designed to follow price movements to provide broader insights. For example, moving averages show where prices have been in the past. While they don’t necessarily predict the future, they can be used to generate buy and sell signals.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p> Traders may use many technical indicators when analyzing a security and/or combine them with other forms of technical analysis, such as candlesticks or chart patterns. The two most common uses of technical indicators are alerting you about possible reversals or confirming other forms of technical analysis that explicitly generate a buy or sell signal. </p>
                        <p> Technical indicators may also form the basis for automated trading systems given their quantitative nature. For example, an automated trading system may generate a buy signal — or even execute a limit order — whenever the RSI crosses below 30.0 and the price rises above the 5-day moving average. </p>

                        <p> Please refer to Paper reading #3 and also any other web information you may find to answer the following questions:
                        <ol>
                            <li> Exponential Moving Average: How does the Exponential Moving Average give more weight to recent prices compared to a simple moving average? </li>
                            <li> Simple Moving Average: What are the strengths and weaknesses of using a Simple Moving Average in trading? </li>
                            <li> Time-Series Moving Average: How does the Time-Series Moving Average differ from traditional moving averages in terms of trend analysis? </li>
                            <li> Triangular Moving Average: What advantages does the Triangular Moving Average offer in smoothing price data? </li>
                            <li> Mass Index: What does the Mass Index indicate about potential trend reversals, and how is it calculated? </li>
                            <li> Relative Strength Index (RSI): How is the RSI used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market? </li>
                            <li> Bollinger Bands: How do Bollinger Bands help traders identify potential market reversals? </li>
                            <li> Momentum: What is the primary purpose of the Momentum indicator, and how is it calculated? </li>
                            <li> Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): What are the key components of the MACD, and how can traders interpret its signals? </li>
                            <li> On Balance Volume: What role does On Balance Volume play in confirming price trends? </li>
                            <li> Parabolic SAR: How does the Parabolic SAR assist traders in identifying potential exit and entry points? </li>
                            <li> Typical Price: How is the Typical Price calculated, and how can it be useful in trading analysis? </li>
                            <li> Directional Movement Index: What are the components of the Directional Movement Index, and how are they interpreted? </li>
                            <li> Utilize specified technical indicators to generate actionable insights for investment decisions, specifically identifying opportunities to buy, sell, or maintain a natural investment position. Students will analyze various indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands, to assess market trends and momentum. By interpreting the signals provided by these indicators, participants will develop clear recommendations based on current market conditions.

                            <li> Let's do ticker selection exercise. Firstly, try to obtain a complete list of ticker symbols (as many as you can) and their historical price data from Yahoo Finance (refer to<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5246843/how-to-get-a-complete-list-of-ticker-symbols-from-yahoo-finance"> this link </a>). Secondly, from this list of tickers, use their fundamental metrics and apply your rules/filters to conduct scenario analyses (i.e., adjust filters to see how the stock list changes, compare against industry averages, etc.) in order to select the top 100 tickers. Thirdly, for these selected 100 tickers, please apply the technical analysis using technical indicatores to simulate daily trading from 10/1/2024 to 10/25/2024 and see what's your investment performance. (Plus alpha, also have a baseline to compare performance of your strateg A with strateg B)

                        <p> Let's practice some basic portfolio optimization! Here are the exerices for Week 8: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Please describe Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) with no more than 5 sentences. </li>

                            <li> Explain what is Value-at-Risk (VaR) and conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) separately. Under what condition(s) will them be equal?  </li>
                            <li> For each of the companies in Question 15 of Week 5, please collect its past three year stock price.  Assuming their returns are goevrn by the log-Normal distribution, use maximum likelihood method to come up with their expected return and co-variance matrix.

                            <li> Based on the estimated expected return and co-variance matrix, draw the efficient frontior with mean variance optimization and CVaR optimization separately. </li>
                            <li> Using the evasive detection technique learned last week, come up with your own prior.  Apply the Black-Litterman allocation technique and come up with an efficient frontier. Discuss the difference between this EF and the two you obatin from above. </li>
